## Skills

#### Planning

The majority of my employment has been in construction, where it is crucial that works are carried out in a logical and time-effective manner.  Once these works had been planned, it was vital to track the progress and check this against the programme.  
This skill lent itself to my coding bootcamp as I was able to effectively plan and sequence my projects in a logical manner, consistently coming back to the plan throughout the work to check on the progress and replan as required.

#### Communication

All of my employment has involved working in teams, with effective communication being key to success.  For example, being able to relay to a construction team the build methodology required, or delivering the technical specifications of surveying equipment to a customer.  
When it comes to programming, I am considered to be a strong communicator due to my ability to take a colleague through my code, confidently ask questions and relay my ideas to a group.

#### Learning

I take a 'high-level' approach to learning.  By ensuring I understand the first-principles of a subject, I know that I can always iron-out the details through further study or through discussions with colleagues.  
This is particularly relevant to programming as memorising syntax is less-effective than understanding what you want the code to ultimately do.  It also allows me to receive, progress and act upon guidance and feedback on my work.

#### Leadership

As of yet, I have not held a position of seniority through work, however I am naturally an aspiring leader.  In my personal life I am frequently finding myself in leadership roles, whether it be undertaking a course to be able to effectively skipper a yacht (day-skipper) or taking on the captaincy and coaching of my University Aussie Rules football team.  I was also the Project Manager for [this construction project](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75983723/118269844-1d636480-b4b7-11eb-9ef1-7033c0a85b42.jpeg).  
More recently, during the Makers Academy Bootcamp, I consistently took the role of the project-driving and proactive team member.  This lead to project tickets being assigned appropriately and group members being included with requests for their thoughts on the work.
