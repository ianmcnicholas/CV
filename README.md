I am a **Junior Software Developer / Programmer** with a background in *Civil Engineering*, *Construction* and *Technical Sales*.  I am looking for a role where I can consolidate and extend my programming knowledge, and work in a team to produce high-quality technical products.

I graduated with a 1st Class Masters Degree in Civil Engineering and started my professional career as an engineer on a construction project in London.  Since then I have worked on several engineering projects, spent time exploring mountainous regions overseas in Canada, and have worked in sales providing highly technical equipment to customers in Australia.
