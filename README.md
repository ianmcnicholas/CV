I am a **Junior Software Developer / Programmer** with a background in *Civil Engineering*, *Construction* and *Technical Sales*.  I am looking for a role where I can consolidate and extend my programming knowledge, and work in a team to produce high-quality technical products.  I consider myself to be open about areas of strength and those requiring improvement and have experience of working in proactive and pragmatic teams.

I graduated with a *1st Class Masters Degree in Civil Engineering* and started my professional career as an engineer on a construction project in London.  Since then I have worked on several engineering projects, spent time exploring mountainous regions overseas in Canada, and have worked in sales providing highly technical equipment to customers in Australia.

## Skills

#### Planning

The majority of my employment has been in construction, where is it crucial that works are carried out in a logical and time-effective manner.  Once these works had been planned, it was also vital to track the progress and check this against the programme.

#### Communication

All of my employment has involved working in teams, with effective communication being key to success.  For example, being able to relay to a team of construction workers the methodology required, or delivering the technical specs of surveying equipment to a customer.

#### Learning

I take a 'high-level' approach to learning.  By ensuring I understand the first-principles of a subject, I know that I can always iron out-the details through further study or through discussions with colleagues.  This is particularly relevant to programming as memorising syntax is less-effective than understanding what you want the code to ultimately do.

#### Programming skills

- Ruby (incl. Rails, RSPEC), Javascript (incl. React), TDD, Github, SQL, API's.
